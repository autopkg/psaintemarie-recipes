# psaintemarie-recipes

These are my recipes for AutoPkg. If you use them, click the â˜…  Star button at the top of the page to show your support.

Many of these (the only two for now) recipes were created with the aid of [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot), an app you should definitely check out.

## Installation

To add my repo to your Mac (with AutoPkg and Git already installed), run this command:

```
autopkg repo-add psaintemarie-recipes
```
## Dependencies

Some of my recipes (may) have parent recipes that live in another repo. Refer to a given recipe's parent recipe identifier to determine which repo you'll need to add. As of today, this is not the case.

## Known issues

Do you have a problem with one of my recipes? [Check the issues](https://github.com/autopkg/psaintemarie-recipes/issues) to see whether a known problem exists. If not, just [submit an issue](https://github.com/autopkg/psaintemarie-recipes/issues/new) so I can take a look.

## Submissions

Forks/pulls/issues are more than welcome. Let's improve together.
